# About Me

 My name is Braden Meyerhoff. I'm in my fourth semester at SWIC working towards an Associate degree in Applied Science
 specializing in Computer Information Systems. In my time at SWIC, I have primarily focused on programming, mainly in
 C#, HTML, and Python.  
 Outside of school, I have worked at Walmart since June of 2021. I worked in apparel for a year before transferring to
 electronics in 2022.

 Some of my hobbies include:
 * Video games
 * Genealogy
 * Football (Dallas Cowboys)

 After school, I am hoping to begin a career as a software developer (ideally as a game dev). After this semester I am aiming to
 get an internship through SWIC's CIS-297 class.
